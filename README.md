# 🏛 Harvard Art Museums ETL & SQL Analytics Dashboard

An **end-to-end data engineering and analytics project** built using the **Harvard Art Museums API**, **MySQL/TiDB**, and **Streamlit**.

This project demonstrates how to:

- Extract large-scale cultural data from a public REST API  
- Normalize nested JSON into relational SQL tables  
- Perform advanced SQL analytics (**25+ queries**)  
- Build an interactive dashboard with safe database controls

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Harvard Art Museums API** provides rich metadata for artworks across classifications such as **Paintings, Prints, Drawings, Photographs, and Sculpture**.

This application implements a complete **ETL pipeline**:

- **Extract** artifacts from the API (2,500 per classification)  
- **Transform** nested JSON into structured tables  
- **Load** data into a relational SQL database  
- **Analyze** data using classification-aware SQL queries  
- **Visualize & explore** results using Streamlit

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Extract
- Fetches artifacts using:
  - `classification`
 - Collects **up to 2,500 records per classification**

### 2️⃣ Transform
- Handles missing and inconsistent metadata  
- Normalizes nested fields (colors, media)  
- Limits colors per artifact for performance  
- Handles sparse fields (`culture`, `period`, `century`)  

### 3️⃣ Load
- Batch inserts using `executemany`  
- Optimized commits  
- Data persists across runs  
- Duplicate-safe inserts using primary keys
